    ["Level 4 - When facing these ships, you may not be able to use gems which sound exactly like the transmission, but remember, all that matters is that the gems are the same distance apart, so using Red and Orange gems would work equally well in a situation where you'd need the Orange and Yellow gems. If you haven't already noticed, the notes the gems emit are not evenly spaced; for example, the Yellow and Green gems are slightly closer to each other than the Red and Orange gems or Orange and Yellow gems are. You'll need to pay close attention to make sure you match the transmission correctly."]]
